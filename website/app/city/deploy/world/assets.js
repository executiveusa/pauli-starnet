     It used to be `drawnHeight × 0.56` for everyone, which assumes every character's legs swing the
     same fraction of its height. They don't — measured across the roster the true figure lands
     between 0.58 and 1.0 of that, so most skins were over-striding by about a third.
     Derive it per set instead, from the set's OWN side view: at full extension the span across the
     foot band is one step (leading foot to trailing foot), and a cycle is two steps. Side views
     only — front and back foreshorten the swing to nothing.
     Sets whose feet never separate (pikachu, capybara — wide-stance animals whose walk is a bob,

  /* ---------- the contact shadow ----------
     A body used to stand on a 2px black bar: a sticker, not a shadow. It read as a little line
     under the feet and gave the crew no weight on the deck. This paints a real pooled shadow.

       shape   a foreshortened ellipse at the station's floor ratio (ry ~ 0.42*rx) — the SAME
               ratio world.js already uses for its ground cues (wake ripple, listening pulse,
               work ring), so every circle that claims to lie on the deck agrees.
       falloff nested ellipses penumbra->umbra instead of one flat blob. The alphas compound
               (1 - PI(1-a)) to ~0.43 at the contact core and 0.09 at the rim — a soft edge for
               no per-frame gradient object, which matters at ~10 bodies x 60fps. The core sits
               deliberately ABOVE propsprites' shadow2 (~0.34): that is a prop's edge contact,
               while this is a whole body standing on the deck, and the deck it has to read
               against is DARK — measured at 26/255 luma under the hero. At 0.34 the pool took
               6 luma off it (23%); a body needs to look planted, not stickered. Do not tune
               these by eye — `node dev/shadowprobe.mjs` measures the pool on the real deck.
       bias    nudged SOUTH-EAST. The station's key light is high and north-west; that is the
               light every prop already assumes (west-biased sheen, north-lit top faces).
       life    `lift` is how far the idle/talk bob has raised the body off the deck. The pool
               shrinks and fades with it, so a breathing body's shadow breathes too and a body
               that rises never drags a full-weight pool up with it.
       seated  a seated body's feet are on a cushion, not the deck — callers hand it a tighter,
               fainter pool rather than claim a full contact it doesn't have.

     Alpha is applied RELATIVE to the incoming ctx.globalAlpha and restored afterwards, so the
     hero's color-into-being fade-up (drawAgent's bornA) survives the shadow pass — the old code
     slammed globalAlpha back to 1 here and silently cancelled that fade for the sprite too. */

     each body carries a render-side facing angle that slews toward what the game wants (the
     continuous walk heading `b.faceA` while walking, the bucketed `dir` otherwise) at the SAME
     rate stepGait turns a walking body, then buckets into EIGHT sectors with hysteresis. A body
     turning 180° therefore walks its pose through the diagonal in ~2 steps instead of teleporting
     it, and a body that stops on a diagonal eases to its cardinal instead of popping.
     Sets that don't ship diagonal frames are untouched: pick8 falls straight back to the old
     4-dir pick on `b.dir`, so this is a no-op for every skin until its diagonals exist. */

     turntable: the pose rotated at constant angular speed and the body appeared to slide around
     its own axis ("it just perfectly spins" — Andrew, 2026-08-01). Two things fix that, and
     neither needs new art:
       1. the facing ACCELERATES and BRAKES. `_rW` is angular velocity, ramped by TURN_ACCEL and
          capped by the sqrt term so it arrives at the target with zero speed instead of stopping
          dead. Same shape as the linear speed easing stepGait already does.
       2. the feet keep the score. `_turnAng` accumulates radians actually swept, and drawBody
          spends it on WALK frames, so a pivoting body steps its legs around instead of holding a
          frozen idle pose while the sprite rotates underneath it. */
